## Development

To install dependencies, you need a [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

The, to install dependencies you should run:
```sh
🐧 poetry install
```

To run the app you need first to setup credentials.

**TODO:** insert instructions

Then you can run app like that:
```sh
🐧 poetry run python bot.py
```

Alternatively if you want to jump into poetry's virtual environment, you can run
```sh
🐧 poetry shell
```
To can exit the venv, just type `exit`

(The penguin 🐧 is the prompt character, do not copy it)
